            The main reason I built this website is to share my ideas,
            creations, and findings on topics that I find interesting. I want to
            focus on making tutorials about software development, and I want to
            write articles about computer science, philosophy, and digital
            illustration. In addition, I want to show my software projects and
            document them on this website, so people can better understand my
            projects and be inspired to create new softwares. Software projects
            that I have created can be seen on the

            Building this website has taught me many things about web
            development. I learned how to make a maintainable web project so
            that it is easier to make changes and add features in the future. I
            have learned how to use the MDN Web Docs as reference when
            developing a website. Clear and comprehensive explanations for HTML
            elements, CSS rules, and JavaScript features are available on the
            MDN Web Docs
            <sup class="citation" data-id="mozilla-docs"></sup>
            . Equally important is that I challenge myself to not use a web
            framework because I want to understand how to build user interface
            components, arrange layouts and style elements using CSS, and add
            behaviors to the elements using JavaScript. Next, I hosted this site
            on GitHub Pages because I can store my code and deploy it on the
            same platform. I can also see the changes on my website after I push
            my code to GitHub.

            I used Visual Studio Code as my code editor. VS Code has been a
            blessing for me because of the editing features, such as
            multi-cursor, Git integration, search feature, side by side editing
            feature, and the Live Server plugin. I used Mozilla Firefox as my
            browser and GitHub to save my code online.

            To manage HTML elements and CSS classes, I used the BEM (Block,
            Element, Modifier) Methodology made by Yandex. BEM is one of the
            approaches to structure the class names and HTML elements .
            According to BEM, A block is a component that can be reused on
            different pages, while an element is a part of a block that cannot
            be used independently
            <sup class="citation" data-id="yandex-docs"></sup>
            . An element has to be inside a block. Further, a modifier is a
            variant, such as style, state, or behavior, of a block or an
            element. I followed the BEM approach because it is the first method
            that I found, and it provides clear instructions on how to name
            elements. In addition, BEM documentation provides many examples and
            cases that make it easier to understand and implement. Additionally,
            I can inspect the BEM website to learn more how the developers apply
            the method.

            Material UI is a React component library that offers production
            grade UI widgets to develop app faster. Its documentation presents a
            rich amount of UI component names and specification on the
            component's style and behavior
            <sup class="citation" data-id="mui-docs"></sup>
            . As such, I used Material UI Documentation as a guide to create
            view components and MUI Blog as a reference for formatting my
            articles and post list.
            <sup class="citation" data-id="mui-blog"></sup>
            As a starting point to style my website, I used MUI's dark mode
            style, emulated MUI components, and modified the components
            according to my needs. For the heading tree sidebar on post detail
            page, I was inspired by the sidebar on MDN Web Docs

            The W3Schools provides many small tutorials in using HTML, CSS, JS
            to create web elements. One of the problems in developing this
            website was HTML element toggling, where if a user clicks on a
            button, another element will show up or disappear
            <sup class="citation" data-id="w3schools-toggle"></sup>
            . To solve web development problems, I synthesized techniques from
            Stack Overflow and W3Schools. Next, since I'm creating a blog, I can
            reference a field-tested blog engine as a starting point. I need to
            know how the article data are stored and retrieved, so I used the
