                    The main reason I built this website is to share my ideas, creations, and findings on topics
                    that I find interesting. I want to focus on making tutorials about software development, and I
                    want to write articles about computer science, philosophy, and digital illustration. In addition, I
                    want to show
                    my software projects and document them on this website, so people can
                    better understand my projects and be inspired to create new softwares. Software projects that I have
                    created can be seen on the

                    Building this website has taught me many things about web development. I learned how to make a
                    maintainable web project so that it is easier to make changes and add features in the future. I have
                    learned how to use the
                    <a class="link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web">
                        MDN Web Docs
                    </a>
                    as reference when developing a website. Equally important is that I challenge myself to not
                    use a web framework because I want to
                    understand how to build user interface components, arrange layouts and style elements using
                    CSS, and add behaviors to the elements using JavaScript. Next, I hosted this site on GitHub Pages
                    because I can store my code and deploy it on the same platform. I can also see the changes on
                    my website after I push my code to GitHub.

                <p class="paragraph post__paragraph">
                    I used Visual Studio Code as my code editor. VS Code has been a blessing for me because of the
                    editing features, such as multi-cursor, Git integration, search feature, side by side editing
                    feature, and the Live Server plugin. I used Mozilla Firefox as my browser and GitHub to save
                    my code online.

                <p class="paragraph post__paragraph">
                    To manage HTML elements and CSS classes, I used the
                    <a class="link" href="https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/">
                        BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) Methodology
                    </a>
                    made by Yandex. A block is a component that can be reused on different pages. An element is a part
                    of a block that cannot be used independently. A modifier is a variant, such as style, state, or
                    behavior, of a block or an element. I followed the BEM approach because it is the first method that
                    I found, and it provides clear instructions on how to organize HTML elements and CSS rules. In
                    addition, BEM documentation provides many examples and cases that make it easier to understand and
                    implement. I can also inspect the BEM website to learn how the developers use the method.
