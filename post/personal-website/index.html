          <p class="paragraph post__paragraph">
            The main reason I built this website is to share my ideas,
            creations, and findings on topics that I find interesting. I want to
            focus on making tutorials about software development, and I want to
            write articles about computer science, philosophy, and digital
            illustration. In addition, I want to show my software projects and
            document them on this website, so people can better understand my
            projects and be inspired to create new software. Projects that I
            have developed can be seen on the
            <a class="link" href="/project/index.html">Projects</a>
            page.

            Learn Building and Hosting a Website
          </h3>
          <p class="paragraph post__paragraph">
            Building this website has taught me many things about web
            development. I learned how to make a maintainable web project so
            that it is easier to make changes and add features in the future. I
            have learned how to study and apply the MDN Web Docs as a reference
            when developing a website. The MDN Web Docs offers clear and
            comprehensive explanations for HTML elements, CSS rules, and
            JavaScript features.<sup
              class="citation"
              data-id="mozilla-docs"
            ></sup>
            Further, I challenge myself not to use a web framework because I
            want to understand how to build a website from scratch and use the
            tool that I personally made. It makes me feel accomplished when I
            finally start to understand things that I used to think were complex
            and difficult. I am curious to learn about building user interface
            components, arranging layouts, and styling elements using CSS, and
            imbuing behaviors to the elements using JavaScript. Next, I hosted
            this site on
            <a class="link" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>
            because I can store my code and deploy it on the same platform. I
            can also see the changes on my website after I push my code to
            GitHub.

          <p class="paragraph post__paragraph">
            I used

              >Visual Studio Code</a
            >
            as my code editor. VS Code has been a blessing for me because of the
            editing features, such as multi-cursor, Git integration, search
            feature, side-by-side editing feature, and the Live Server plugin. I
            utilized Mozilla Firefox as my browser to display the website and
            GitHub to store my code and its history online.

            The Block, Element, Modifier (BEM) Methodology made by Yandex is
            used as a guideline to manage HTML elements and CSS classes. BEM is
            one of the approaches to structuring the class names and HTML
            elements. A block is a component that can be reused on different
            pages, while an element is a part of a block that cannot be used
            independently outside of the block.<sup
              class="citation"
              data-id="bem-docs"
            ></sup>
            An element has to be contained in a block. Further, a modifier is a
            variant, such as style, state, or behavior, of a block or an
            element. I followed the BEM approach because it is the first method
            that I found, and it provides clear instructions on how to organize
            class names. In addition, the method’s documentation provides many
            examples and cases that make it easier to understand and implement
            it. Additionally, I can inspect the BEM website to learn more on how
            the developers apply the method.

            Material UI is a React component library that offers
            production-grade UI widgets to develop applications more
            rapidly.<sup class="citation" data-id="mui-docs"></sup>
            Its documentation presents a rich amount of UI component names and
            specifications on the component's style and behavior. As such, I
            used Material UI Documentation as a guide to create view components
            and
            <a class="link" href="https://mui.com/blog/">MUI Blog</a>
            as a reference for formatting my articles and post list.

            was inspired by the expandable tree-like sidebar on MDN Web Docs and

            Many useful tutorials on using HTML, CSS, and JS to create web
            elements are scattered over the internet. One of the problems in
            developing this website was HTML element toggling, where if a user
            clicks on a button, another element will show up or disappear. I
            learned that toggling can be done by applying or removing a certain
            CSS attribute, i.e., display.<sup
              class="citation"
              data-id="w3schools-toggle"

            To solve web development problems, I synthesized techniques from
            various sources, mainly Stack Overflow, GeeksforGeeks, and
            W3Schools.

            Next, since I'm creating a blog, I can reference a field-tested blog
            engine as a starting point. I need to know how the article data is
            stored and retrieved, thus, I use the database design of WordPress
            in developing this blog's database. The WordPress database schema
            explains in great detail the tables, relationships, and each table’s
            attributes.<sup class="citation" data-id="wordpress-db"></sup>
            The reason is that WordPress is a mature blog creator, so I can
            study the tables and their relationships to find the bare minimum
            structure for a functional blog. Based on the database schema of
            WordPress, I think the critical tables are post, post terms or
            categories, and users.
